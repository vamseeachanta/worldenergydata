# Plan review synthesis for #394: chore(repo-structure): normalize worldenergydata folder/file structure

Date: 2026-05-08
Plan: `docs/plans/2026-05-08-issue-394-repo-structure-normalization.md`

## Verdict

APPROVE for human `status:plan-review` gate. Implementation remains blocked pending explicit user approval.

## Reviewer lanes

| Lane | Verdict | Findings |
|---|---:|---|
| Scope discipline | APPROVE | Plan is Phase-1 bounded and forbids broad moves/deletions before contract/checker/TDD. |
| Verification/TDD | MINOR | Test list is explicit; implementation must convert it into repo-specific tests before checker code. |
| Risk/rollback | APPROVE | Generated-output and durable-evidence exception handling is explicit; rollback/approval marker required. |

## Accepted hardening notes

- Keep generated-looking tracked files in place until classified.
- Require machine-readable exception metadata rather than ad hoc ignores.
- Treat static/docs/strategy repos differently from Python package repos; no source/runtime path move without proof.
- Preserve approval SHA in `.planning/plan-approved/394.md` after approval.

## Residual risk

Medium: implementation inventory may discover repo-specific path consumers or generated artifacts requiring follow-up issues. This is acceptable because the plan makes those discoveries blocking/classification events rather than implicit cleanup permission.

## Ready for approval

yes — ready for user review; no implementation authorized.
