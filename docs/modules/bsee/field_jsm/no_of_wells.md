Guys, this item on a webpage by Oil and Gas World, 07Sep’20  appears to define Stage/Phase 3 as being comprised of adding THREE producers(?) [Note that it is not clear whether Jack got 1, 2, or all 3 wells… but, probably 1 for Jack & 2 for St. Malo]:

Steve Thurston, vice president of Exploration and Projects at Chevron, explains that we elected for a joint development to “reduce cost and capture scale” and had field development occur in two stages for “learning and risk reduction.” Stage 1 was put in production in 2014 – on time and under budget. Stage 2 was completed in 2018. In 2019, Stage 3 development drilling continued with one well in the Jack Field starting production and another reaching total depth. A final well is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020. A final investment decision was reached on the St. Malo Stage 4 waterflood project in August 2019. That project includes two new production wells, three injector wells, and topsides water injection equipment. First injection is expected in 2023.
While 1st injection was supposed to start in 2023, it did not happen until Q3’24.
Vamsee’s deep-dive into BOEM database should clarify which reservoir got each of the THREE WELLS in Phase 3.

Guys, even though we will probably never get a clear picture of how much money has been and will end up being invested in (& spent on operations for) these 2 elephants, I hope we can tie down officially reported specifics on:

OIP
Reserves (i.e., recoverable bbls & boe)
Total number of well bores by type from/including discovery & appraisal
NOTE – we do already have the total exploration/appraisal well bore data
Total number of & key drilling details for completions by type
Detailed individual well production data / profiles
Average total daily, monthly, annual production bbls & boe
Cum. Produced by year.
More???

I have pulled off some interesting but confusing “data” from articles online from:

JSM fact sheet by CVX (attached), 2016 –
The fields are approximately 280 miles south of New Orleans 25 miles apart, in ~7000ft WD.
Reservoir depths are in the order of 26,500 feet.
Electric seafloor pumps are used to assist production to the host.
Production from FIRST stage is expected to ramp up over the next several years to a total of 105Kbopd + 26Mcfd of natural gas, with the capability for future expansion.
With a planned production life > 30 years, current technologies should yield >500Mboe recovery.
Stages 1 & 2 è 13 wells… per CVX’s JSM 2016 brochure
After discovery in 2003, CVX had drilled 7 E&A wells and 9 producers thru Q1’2016
By the end of Q1’2016, production had reached 75Kboepd
The WR regional host can handle 170Kbopd+42Mcfd and serves as host for JULIA.
Stage 1 put 9 wells on stream (4 producers at JACK and 5 producers at St. Malo)
Stage 2 added 4 wells (2 producers at JACK and 2 producers at St. Malo)
Stage 3… ???
Stage 3… ???
03May2017, UPSTREAM wrote that CVX had sanctioned Ph. 3… but, I don’t have subscription to get article
22Mar2024, OFFSHORE TECHNOLOGY website –
Stage three included the drilling of two additional wells at the Jack field.
But, also says…
The initial phases of development involved drilling ten production wells: four at Jack and six at St Malo.
The development also involved drilling 43 subsea wells, which are tied back to the Jack/St. Malo semisubmersible floating production unit.
???
Stage 4… EQUINOR website, 20Sep’19 –
Equinor announced today the sanction of a waterflood project in the St. Malo field in the US Gulf of Mexico.
This waterflood project, sanctioned in the resource-rich Wilcox formation in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, is expected to contribute an estimated ultimate recovery of more than 150-175 million barrels of oil equivalent. Equinor holds a 21.5% working interest in the St. Malo field.
The project will include two new production wells, three new injector wells, and topsides injection equipment to the Jack/St. Malo floating production unit, allowing us to extend the life of the field.
CVX website, 03Sep’24 (5yrs later)–
At the Jack/St. Malo facility, Chevron achieved first water injection at the St. Malo field, the company’s first waterflood project in the deepwater Wilcox trend. The project was delivered under budget, with the addition of water injection facilities, two new production wells, and two new injection wells. It is expected to add approximately 175 million barrels of oil equivalent to the St. Malo field’s gross ultimate recovery.
Original FID for this Stage 4 project called for TWO producers & THREE injectors… so, they stayed under budget by dropping one of the injectors???
Since production started in 2014, JSM has cumulatively produced ~ 400 million gross BOE.
 

So, some questions:

Does the water injection project / Phase 4 bring the combined reserves to 675Mboe (or 575Mboe)?
Does the “FORTY-THREE (43) wells” include more fields than just JSM… e.g., JULIA and others?
Where/how could that number be justified… see below from OE???
How many rigs are needed develop and operate JSM + JULIA?
Other q’s???
 

From good article in OFFSHORE ENGINEER, by Karen Boman, 01JULY2017

She mentions that a Third Phase has been sanctioned (but no details ☹)
And discusses the E-STMZ Completion technology…
By Chevron and Halliburton teamed up in 2007 to develop an enhanced single trip multi-zonal completion system (EMTSZ) (OE: December 2014). This technology allows an operator to run and fracture five zones in a single trip. The ability to reduce the number of trips to perforate wells save not only time, but drilling rig day rate costs, Flowers said.
At Jack/St. Malo, Halliburton’s tool allowed Chevron to conduct successful hydraulic fracturing jobs to effectively open up cliff-based inflow wells. Unique production tracers in each zone allowed Chevron to study samples. As a result, the Jack/St. Malo completion team completed 47 fracs in 10 wells without missing the target, Flowers said.
Besides the first successful demonstration of the completion system, one of the biggest wells that Chevron has ever drilled was at Jack/St. Malo. For that well, Chevron ran a 2.3 million-pound casing string. Chevron also is seeing the highest completion pressure its ever seen, with Jack/St. Malo wells at 9500psi.

Roy and Chuck,

Attached are the well data for Julia and Jack & St. Malo. Stones is pending. Production data for these are pending.

As mentioned, BSEE data download is not straightforward and need some hand-holding. AI for analysis will also need some handholding when you get your hands on the fields we provide. 
FYI, In all our coding, we leveraging AI even for everything but convert them to codes where possible for repeatability and reusability and traceability. Of courese, feel free to use your own independent judgement on how to use AI.

For Jack & St. Malo wells, we got the data directly from BSEE. The blocks for jack are WR 758, WR 759. THe blocks for St. Malo are WR 678. The well data is attached and the number of API12 wells are given below. Status of these wells is to be determined.:
- Jack, WR758: 40
- Jack, WR759: 8
- St. Malo, WR678: 20 

From production data from blocks WR540 and 584, we got API12s from notes and articles as follows:

| Stage | Field | Purpose | Well Count | Total Wells | First Oil Year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Jack | Production | 4 | 4 | 2014 |
| 1 | St. Malo | Production | 5 | 9 | 2014 |
| 2 | Jack | Production | 2 | 11 | 2017 |
| 2 | St. Malo | Production | 2 | 13 | 2017 |
| 3 | Jack | Production | 0 | 13 | |
| 3 | St. Malo | Production | 0 | 13 | |
| 3 | ? | Injectors | 0 | 13 | |
| 4 | ? | Production | 2 |  15 | 2019 |
| 4 | ? | Injection | 3 | 18 | 2019 |

Vamsee, it would really be great to know what’s really been happening at / for JSM. The attached 2019 news article about “Stage 4” indicates that the big FPS acts as the hub for 43 (FORTY-THREE!) wells. The initial big brochure by CVX and O&GJ (published in 2016???) indicated that “Phase 1” had 9 wells (4@ Jack & 5@ St. Malo)… and, says that “Stage 2” adds just 2 wells at Jack and 2 at St. Malo with 1st oil from Stage 2 expected in 2017.

The 2019 article about the $2B waterflood says that Stage 4 adds just 2 producers and 3 injectors (plus topside facilities). The “D&C+tieback, etc” for Stage 4 project averages out to about $400M/well tied back… which lines up reasonably well with the cost per tied back well for the 20 wells cited in the 2015 EIA/HIS report data on JSM. Therein, 20 wells were reported to be D&C’d+tied back for $9.7B.

How does one get from 13 wells to 43 tied back?

Also, the big CVX brochure on JSM says that the 2 fields provide an estimated oil-equivalent recoverable resource exceeding 500Mboe. The 2019 article might be saying that Stage 4 adds 175Mbbls to the project… or that JSM’s total recoverable is now estimated to be just 175Mbbls. That would be a huge drop if CVX really spent $12B for initial stages and $20B to bring the total well count to FORTY-THREE!
