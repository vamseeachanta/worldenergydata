This is as far as I got in relation to specific documents submitted with APM applications. I was interested in the equipment being used in terms of specs, P+ID, ops procedures etc. since BSEE have to review and approve.

 

I have not pursued a FOI request at this point.

 

It is slightly different to what you are looking at however the combination of the two, assuming the information I am looking for can be obtained, would be a powerful data base if we could start to compile.

 

The challenge from my side with your information is that I would like to focus on subsea wells only that involve either MODU, Cat B or RLWI vessels.

Good afternoon Mr. Johnston, 

 

This is in response to your earlier inquiry to BSEE Public Affairs requesting information and procedures on how to access specific pdf files/documents in an APM Report that you had sent us with attachments. 

Per our Office of District Field Operations team, they advised that these documents are not made available to the public via our online information sources for public access. You may, however, possibly attain access by requesting a FOIA Document Request through our FOIA Department. 

Here is the link to those pages and procedures:

 

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) | Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement

 

Make a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request | U.S. Department of the Interior

 

Thank you.

 

v/r,

 

Bill
