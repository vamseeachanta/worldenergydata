Performed test #1; reduced pressure to 1500 psi and activated the deadman system with ST locks on-line and performed a 15;000 psi test.  Performed test #2; increased the deadman pressure to full operating pressure (4000 psi); isolated the ST locks; activated the deadman system and performed a 15;000 psi test.  Attempted to perform 15;000 psi pressure test to ensure ram integrity.  The lower DVS rams would not hold pressure; test failed due to suspected worn ram packers after upper DVS shear rams were functioned numerous time.  Continued with test #2 and noticed the control lines going to the starboard ST locks for upper DVS shear rams were installed opposite of the rest of the ST locks.  Reinstalled the hose to the ST locks and functioned deadman system.  Pressure test performed to 15;000 psi; did not hold straight line.  Subsea will activate deadman system by shutting off hydraulics and turning off the power and apply 15;000 psi to ensure system integrity minus ram; packers will be replaced after all function testing has been completed.
