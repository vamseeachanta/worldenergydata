-129974,"Current Status: The GA 209 A-1D was drilled and completed in 1990 as a dual cased-
                hole gravel pack to the MM-20 reservoir. The short string SCSSV 
                was tested on 08/16/2010, and would not test closed. Attempts 
                were made to get the valve working again, including using acid 
                and an exercise tool to manipulate the flow tube. These efforts 
                proved unsuccessful.

                On 09/04/2010, an attempt was made to install a surface- 
                controlled insert valve. While attempting to perform the 
                installation, it was discovered flow couplings, which have a 
                restricted inner diameter, were installed below the SCSSV. This
                prevents the installation of the insert valve which isolates 
                across the original SCSSV flapper and has the surface-controlled
                insert valve hanging below. The valve manufacturer (Baker Hughes)
                informed Exxon Mobil their existing system will not work and they 
                cannot provide an insert valve.

                The well has been shut in since discovery of the failed TRSCSSV 
                test. We are requesting permission to install a PB valve to allow
                this well to flow once again. The latest well tests and the 
                proposed wellbore diagram are attached.

CURRENT PERFORATIONS: MM-20    8,702'-8,769'MD/8,181'-8,249'TVD

FORWARD PLAN:  Plan to lock open SCSSV and install PB valve in landing nipple at
               ±993 ft MD in order to bring the well back on production. 

PROPOSED PROCEDURES: 

1.   MIRU equipment.

2.   RU w/l equipment, test lubricator to 250/1500 psi. 

3.   Pull DXX plug from SCSSV profile at ±927 ft MD.

4.   RIH and lock open TRSCSSV.
 
5.   RIH and set PB valve in HWS landing nipple at ±993 ft WLM. 

6.   RDMO equipment turn over to production.

-136933,"CURRENT STATUS:
The GA 209 A-001D was drilled and completed in 1990 as a dual-cased hole gravel pack to the MM-20 reservoir.  The short string SCSSV was tested in August of 2010 and would not test closed.  Attempts were made to get the valve working again, including using acid and an exercise tool to manipulate the flow tube.  These efforts proved unsuccessful.

On 09/04/2010, an attempt was made to install a surface-controlled insert valve. While attempting to perform the installation, it was discovered flow couplings, which have a restricted inner diameter, were installed below the SCSSV.  This
prevents the installation of the insert valve which isolates across the original SCSSV flapper and has the surface-controlled insert valve hanging below.  The valve manufacturer (Baker Hughes)informed ExxonMobil that their existing system will not work and they cannot provide an insert valve.  A DXX plug was set in the landing nipple at 882' while investigating options to install a subsurface-controlled subsurface safety valve and return the well to production.

The BOEM was contacted to request a departure to install the SSCSV and we were told to submit an APM for the departure, which we did, and the BOEM approved it.  Afterward, based on a review and analysis of the flow characteristics of the well, it was concluded that flowing the well with the PB valve would be problematic so we opted to not act on that permit/departure and left the pump-through plug in place.  The well has been shut-in since discovery of the failed tubing retrievable SCSSV test, the failed attempts to repair the valve, and the wireline insert of the pump-through tubing plug.  The short string is currently shut-in with the DX plug in place. 

Assuming it would be important to inform the BOEM that we did not act on the permit which was also a departure approval, we contacted the BOEM to inform them of such and that we had set a pump-through tubing plug instead.  The ensuing conversation resulted in Mr. Kassim informing us that 30 CFR 250.601(b) is intended to mean ""like"" and ""in kind"" replacements of pump-through plugs and SSVs via wireline and does not pertain to 'in addition' or to 'change' actions.

ExxonMobil's interpretation of 30 CFR 250.601(b) had been that removing and setting pump-through type tubing plugs and subsurface safety valves performed via wireline operations was considered routine. Mr. Kassim informed us that we were mistaken and requested we submit an RPM to the existing APM requesting that APM/departure to be cancelled.  He also requested that we submit an ""after the fact"" APM to reflect the pump-through tubing plug being installed in the short string.  This APM is intended to meet that request.

An operational summary of the procedure followed in September of 2010 (which we felt was a routine operation) for installing the DXX plug is as follows:

1. Rig up lubricator on short string and test to 250 psi low and 1500 psi high.

2. Set DXX plug in landing nipple at 882'.  Test plug.

3. Rig down lubricator from short string."
